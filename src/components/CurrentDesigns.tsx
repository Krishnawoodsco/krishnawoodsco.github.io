                  <p className="font-garamond">We make custom tables that allow full control over your design. You may customize your finish and materials as well as have full control over all dimensions of height and width. Our products stand out with no factory-made parts, meaning all work is done through purely artisan-handled efforts from sanding to joinery to every step of the process.</p>

                  <p className="font-garamond">Your design will be something you can't match as perfectly to anything available in the market. You have ultimate control over the design process with access to Blender renders and 3D files that you can install right into your product renders, giving your projects a connection to luxury in not just product quality but also image.</p>

                  <p className="font-garamond">We are extremely dedicated to being reliable, transparent, and always on time. We make sure no process goes uninformed from you, and in fact, all of our products come with a log book documenting every step, allowing you and your client to have more detail about a single product's origins and history than a dozen products combined.</p>
